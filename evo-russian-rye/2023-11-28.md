#### notes

realize I should use dark rye not light rye

no starter
two breads simultaneously

forgot to do second fold
didn't really rise, yeast might be weak so added more
- yeast still seems weak

made one boule, one loaf

realize I should really use more water, ~500g

rise and proof didn't do much

oven spring was ok
