## rising
folds
1. 14:45
1. 15:00
2. 15:15

shaping 20:00 (4ish h rise in oven bread proof)

## baking

bake 22:30 (1h oven bread proof)
- 470 degrees
- 20 min covered
- 15 min uncovered

## notes
- trying out more water 
- rise in oven with bread proof seems pretty good
- fridge proof is better but oven proof is fast and works
- didn't get enough rise during proof, probably should have waited longer
- experimented with setting to 470, seems fine!
