## notes
- added more starter (55g)
- placed on table, half leaning over warm spot above heater

- way too risen, way too wet
    - increased sourdough + probably too high temp above heater
    - added a bunch of flour and tried to knead it into something :/

- barely proofed
    - clearly over-risen

- bad oven spring
