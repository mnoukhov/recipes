This recipe follows [Andrew Janjigian's The Loaf](https://web.archive.org/web/20210207161650/https://wordloaf.substack.com/p/thursday-recipe-the-loaf) and can be seen as a simplification or faster version of Ken Forkish's overnight levain white. The main improvement is using a starter straight from the fridge. My version differs from Andrew's in that he calls for a single fold after 30 minutes whereas I still add extra folds within the first 1.5 hours as Ken recommends. I also regularly use a starter that has been in the fridge for more than 10 days and in those cases let the bulk fermentation go for a bit longer or use a bit more levain.
