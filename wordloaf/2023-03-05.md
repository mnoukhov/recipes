## notes
rise
- added a bit less starter than last time (55 -> 45g)
- placed on kitchen counter
- good rise!

proof
- fridge proof was good
- came out of basket pretty easy

bake
- parchment paper + single incision
- ok oven spring
- too many cracks, shouldn't have used the lame
- pretty good resulting loaf!
