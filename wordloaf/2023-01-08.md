2. 23:05
2. 23:35

shaping 10:30 (12h rise in on countertop above heater)

## baking

bake l4:00 (3h30 oven bread proof)
- 470 degrees
- 20 min covered
- 15 min uncovered

## notes
- didn't have enough white so doing more whole wheat
- added a bit more starter because of the whole wheat
- very sticky dough during shaping, countertop maybe too hot?
- forgot about the bread and overproofed :/

- trying out more water 
- rise in oven with bread proof seems pretty good
- fridge proof is better but oven proof is fast and works
- didn't get enough rise during proof, probably should have waited longer
- experimented with setting to 470, seems fine!
