## baking
20:30 bake (6h fridge + 2h counter proof)
- 475 degrees
- 30 min covered
- 10 min uncovered

## notes
forgot to turn on oven and overproofed
- should have been 1h counter
- left bread on counter for too long and it lost shape
- still good air bubbles, just not a lot of rise

maybe try lower temp next time?
