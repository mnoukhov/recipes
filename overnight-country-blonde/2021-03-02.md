## notes
drier dough than usual
- more ww and rye in field blend
- actually started with correct amount of water

small dough ball after rise
- it's cold but maybe on top of fridge isn't ideal?

not a lot of rise during proof
- finger poke test seemed fine though

not much oven spring
- all issues could just be hydration?
