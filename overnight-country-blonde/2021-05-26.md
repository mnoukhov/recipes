## notes
seems like fridge starter is fine during warmer weather

rise might have been too long
- 12h likely max in the summer
- slept in :|

uncovered proof
- much easier to invert!
    - less flour in banneton next time
- skin on top actually helps for transfer
- not a lot of proof, but decent

baking
- higher temp (475) and less covered (22 min) reduced overbrowned bottom
- alright oven spring
