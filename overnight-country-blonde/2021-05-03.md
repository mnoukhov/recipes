## notes
leaving starter out to sour before putting back in fridge
- maybe can try to leave it out all the time if I'm baking frequently enough?

great rise
- huge air bubbles even after shaping

first loaf
- regular side proof and using basket + cover
- easy to invert, should have done it directly into pot?
- a little burnt on bottom

second loaf
- inverted proof using banneton
- a bit of sticking but no rips
- deep slice in the middle looked good!
    - maybe flowers next time?
