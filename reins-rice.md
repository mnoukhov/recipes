# A step-by-step guide to making rice on a stovetop

From Rein, who never used a rice cooker and refused to even entertain the idea

## Prep
1. If you want it to clump less, rinse the rice
    - Pour the rice into a bowl
    - Pour in cold water and swish it around until the water gets murky
    - Use your hand to block the rice and drain the water
    - You can repeat 1-2 times more until the water stays clear 

## Cook
1. Pour rice and water (1:2 ratio) into pot, give it a stir
2. Stir in seasonings: salt, pepper, bouillon cubesâ€¦
3. Turn to highest and wait for rice to boil
4. Once water is boiling, stir the rice and wait for it to boil again
5. Repeat until boils quickly (1-2 seconds) after stirring
6. Cover with lid and turn down to lowest possible setting 
7. Wait 20 minutes 
8. Turn off the heat, and remove the lid (careful, hot steam will come out)
9. Use a fork to fluff up the rice
10. Cover with the lid and wait another 2-5 minutes
11. Done
