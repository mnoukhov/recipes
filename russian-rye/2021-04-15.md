## notes

used whole instead of rye for starter
- same as og starter

starter is bubbly

parchment paper in form

dough still felt too dry
- added 45g water this time

mixed more thoroughly

slight rise but didn't feel like 2x
- weak sourdough?
- cold house?
- sourdough doesn't like to eat rye?

final bread
- decent rise
- still not browned enough on the top
- broiling to brown top doesn't work :(
