## notes
starter smells more sourdough-y this time
- maybe just needed more time to sour up after that mixup

great rise
- looked really big even after shaping
- more than 12 hours is probably too much

trying inverted proof

forgot about it and worried about overproof
- last 30m in fridge

stuck to banneton on inversion
- definitely some deflation :(
- no rips though, so got to do decorative lame-ing

great oven spring and final result
- "prettier" than non-inverted proof
- should cut deeper with lame next time
