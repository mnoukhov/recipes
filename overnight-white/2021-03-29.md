## notes
starter felt better later?
- maybe fridge starter needs longer to get going

less hydration working
- more manageable and oven spring still ok

main issue coming from inversion + putting into cast iron
- dough sticking to banneton = crack
- cracks = uncontrolled oven spring
- next time will try no-bag proof
