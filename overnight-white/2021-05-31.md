## notes
seems like fridge starter is fine during warmer weather
- 7-9h is peak

rise felt good
- 13h is probably max in the summer

uncovered proof and less flour
- sticking a bit but ok
- good proof

baking
- slighly lower temp (470) and even less covered (20 min)
- good rise, decent browning all around
