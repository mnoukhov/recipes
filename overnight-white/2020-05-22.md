2nd fold 21h45
3rd fold 22h30
4th fold 23h10
5th fold 01h00
- tried extra folds

rise 15h30
- much better rise than usual
- smaller amount of starter seems to help

shaping 12h30
- tighter ball but still had air

proofing 3h45
- forgot to poke test

## baking
- bad inversion, stuck to banneton
- need to clean, redust banneton

16h15
480 degrees
- oven spring not great, make tighter ball and longer preheat
30 min covered
15 min uncovered
- not terrible but not great rise
- issue was likely banneton inversion
- less starter seems to be a good improvement
- more folds are also giving better gluten
