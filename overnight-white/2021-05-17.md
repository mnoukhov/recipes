## notes
leaving starter out to sour before putting back in fridge
- maybe can try to leave it out all the time if I'm baking frequently enough?

rise was too long
- 12h likely max in the summer
- proof didn't rise as much

first loaf
- banneton still sticking a bit
- less time covered makes more even browning
- ok oven spring

second loaf
- much longer proof
