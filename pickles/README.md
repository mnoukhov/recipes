## Ingredients
- cucumbers
    - wash and scrub
    - remove butts of cucumbers
    - poke them with a knife (helps the brine pentrate thicker cucumbers, optional for smaller ones)
- dill with "umbrellas"
    - you want summer dill that's long and has the yellow flowers
    - rip or cut off the root-like ends
    - pull off any old, wilted pieces
    - add the dill, stems and all, into the
- horseradish (or any tannic) leaves
    - it makes picles more crunchy
    - (Mom) uses grape leaves, says oak is also OK
- chopped garlic
    - (BA Brad) you can just crush to release allicin
- (addition) pickling spice
    - (Michael) 1.5 tbsp / L of brine
- (addition) black currant leaves for flavour

- brine
    - 1 litre of water
    - 1.5 tbsp of pickling (or kosher) salt (Mom uses 2)
    - 0.5 tbsp of sugar (Mom says optional)


## Prepare
Bowl method
- put all ingredients into bowl
- cover with plate and weight down so cucumbers are below water level
- cover that with a bag to prevent dust

Jar method (I prefer this)
- put all ingredients into bowl
    - I do herbs + spices first, then pickles, then garlic, then brine
    - make sure cucumbers are jammed in so they can't float to the top
- cover with jar lid (but don't tighten)

Lightly pickled in 24 hours
- (Mom) More sour in 3 days

Place in fridge to slow fermentation, they will still get more sour with time
